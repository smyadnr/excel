# Excel Project README

This project reflects a budget and expense summary, including a saving goal and a monthly spending summary pivot table. 
I have provided the Excel file along with screenshots of each Excel sheet to facilitate viewing without the need for downloading the .xlsx file.

The budget and expense sheet features a chart to visualize income versus expense and spending by category.
Additionally, the saving goal sheet incorporates scroll bars to enhance convenience in performing calculations.
